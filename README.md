# Problem-solving-with-TypeScript

#### Question 1 : What are some benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript in a project?

Answer 1 : TypeScript can define type in his code but JavaScript can't define any properties type. And typescript provide us excellant error support by code editor so that we can find error on the spot in code editor and dont need be run to find error . This enhence our code error checking, and debugging  and make development more efficient.  Especially for large codebases typeScript's type annotations make it easier to understand and maintain code.

#### Question 2 : What is the purpose of the optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators in TypeScript, and how do they work? Provide an example for each.

Answer 2: optional chaining
